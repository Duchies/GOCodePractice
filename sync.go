sync map : chatGPT stuff 
question on below code : how it will give error because each time we are adding different key in map
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    var (
        data  = make(map[int]int)
        wg    sync.WaitGroup
    )

    for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(i int) {
            defer wg.Done()
          
            data[i] = i * 10 // example value
          
        }(i)
    }

    wg.Wait() // wait for all goroutines to finish

    fmt.Println("Map contents after all goroutines finish:")
  
    for k, v := range data {
        fmt.Printf("Key: %d, Value: %d\n", k, v)
    }
   
}

Excellent! You're absolutely right to question this. Let's break it down with full clarity.

🧠 Your Logic (Correct Thinking):
You are adding different keys (1 to 10) in each goroutine — so there's no collision on keys.

So a common intuition is:

"Since each goroutine writes a different key, why should it crash?"

🧨 The Reality in Go:
Even if keys are different, the map's internal structure (like buckets, hash lists, resizing, etc.) is shared, and writing from multiple goroutines at once can corrupt that structure.

👉 So the problem isn't key collision.
The problem is simultaneous write access to the underlying map memory layout.

📌 Example of Bad Code Without Mutex:
go
Copy
Edit
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
)

func main() {
    data := make(map[int]int)
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(i int) {
            defer wg.Done()
            data[i] = i * 10 // concurrent write without protection
        }(i)
    }

    wg.Wait()
    fmt.Println("Done")
}
🔥 Output (intermittent):
Sometimes: It works.

Sometimes: It crashes with:

go
Copy
Edit
fatal error: concurrent map writes
Why? Because Go detects unsynchronized access and panics to protect you.

✅ Key Rules from Go's memory model
Action	Safe on map?	Why
One goroutine writing	✅	No concurrency
Multiple goroutines reading	✅	Read-only is safe
Multiple goroutines writing	❌	Unsafe, can panic
One writing + one reading	❌	Race condition

🛠 How to Fix?
✅ Add sync.Mutex around map access.

✅ Or use sync.Map.

✅ Or send all operations through a channel to one goroutine (actor model).

TL;DR
Even if you write different keys, the map can still panic because map writes are not atomic operations and can conflict internally.
